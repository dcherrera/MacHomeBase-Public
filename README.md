## 🙏 About This Project

MacHomeBase is a passion project created by David Herrera, an individual developer who missed Launchpad after Apple removed it. While it would be nice to earn something from this work, the primary goal is simply to restore functionality that many macOS users relied on.

This GitHub repository exists purely for practical reasons - GitHub's issue tracking and community management tools are excellent, regardless of whether a project is open source or not.
