A: Basic customization is available now, with more spacing and layout options planned for future Pro features.

A: Simply drag one app onto another app. A folder will be created instantly containing both apps.

**Q: How do I add apps to existing folders?**
A: Drag any app onto an existing folder to add it to that folder.
